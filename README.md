# NFL Data Analysis #

## Overview ##
This repository contains Python scripts for analyzing NFL data from a CSV file. The analysis focuses on team performance, including win-loss records, playoff appearances, and points scored. There are two sub-scripts in this repository (script1.py and script2.py which provide different insights on the dataset.

## Script1  ##

### Description ###

Script1 processes NFL data to analyze team performance for team-year combinations. It calculates win-loss-tie records, total points scored, and playoff status for each team in each specified year. *Function2* currently has an output for every team-year combination, but the *Function* can be changed to find insights for all teams in a specific year, all years for a specific team, or a specific team-year combination.

### Requirements ###

*pandas*

*numpy* 

## Script2 ##

### Description ###

Script2 focuses on non-playoff teams, identifying the top scorer among these teams for each year. It retrieves team abbreviations, calculates total points, and determines the highest-scoring non-playoff team for each year.

### Requirements ###

*pandas*

*numpy*

## Dataset and Acknowledgements ##
The scripts use data from all NFL games beginning September 2000 through the end of the 2023 season. The data is stored in the NFL_data.csv file, which is provided in the repository for your reference.
